For Earth, this velocity is approximately **11.2 km/s** (or 11,200 m/s).\n\n#### Formula:\nThe escape velocity \\(v_e\\) is calculated using:\n\\[\nv_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant (\\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}  \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}\\)),\n- \\(M\\) is Earth's mass (\\(5.972 \\times 10^{24}  \\text{kg}\\)),\n- \\(r\\) is Earth's radius (\\(6.371 \\times 10^6  \\text{m}\\)).\n\n#### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n1. **Numerator (\\(2GM\\))**:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times G \\times M = 2 \\times (6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (5.972 \\times 10^{24}) = 7.972 \\times 10^{14}  \\text{m}^3 \\text{s}^{-2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by radius (\\(r\\))**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2GM}{r} = \\frac{7.972 \\times 10^{14}}{6.371 \\times 10^6} = 1.251 \\times 10^8  \\text{m}^2 \\text{s}^{-2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Square root**:\n   \\[\n   v_e = \\sqrt{1.251 \\times 10^8} \\approx 11,186  \\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to km/s**:\n   \\[\n   v_e \\approx 11.2  \\text{km/s} \\quad (\\text{rounded to one decimal place})\n   \\]\n\n#### Physics Behind Escape Velocity:\nEscape velocity arises from the **conservation of energy**. An object must overcome Earth's gravitational potential energy to escape to infinity (where kinetic energy is zero).\n\n1. **Total Energy**:\n   - At launch, the object has **kinetic energy** (\\(K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\)) and **gravitational potential energy** (\\(U = -\\frac{GMm}{r}\\)).\n   - Total energy: \\(E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\).\n\n2. **Escape Condition**:\n   - To escape, the object must reach infinity with zero kinetic energy (i.e., \\(K = 0\\) at \\(r = \\infty\\), where \\(U = 0\\)).\n   - Thus, the **minimum total energy required is zero**:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} \\geq 0\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(v\\):\n     \\[\n     v \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Independence of mass**: The escape velocity does not depend on the object's mass (\\(m\\) cancels out). A rocket and a baseball need the same speed to escape.\n   - **Role of gravity**: Earth's gravity pulls the object back. Escape velocity is the speed where kinetic energy equals the binding energy of gravity.\n   - **Atmospheric drag**: In reality, atmospheric friction requires additional energy, so actual rockets need higher speeds or propulsion.\n   - **Rotational effects**: Earth's rotation reduces the required velocity for eastward launches (e.g., from the equator), but the calculated \\(v_e\\) is the theoretical minimum.\n\n#### Why 11.2 km/s?\n- This value is derived from Earth's mass and radius. If Earth were less massive or larger, escape velocity would be lower (e.g., the Moon's is 2.4 km/s). For comparison, escape velocity from the Sun is 618 km/s, highlighting Earth's relatively weak gravity.\n\n#### Summary:\nEscape velocity is the speed where an object's kinetic energy equals the gravitational potential energy needed to reach infinity. For Earth, it is **11.2 km/s**, calculated using fundamental physics principles and constants. This concept is crucial for space missions, ensuring objects can leave Earth's gravitational influence.","refusal":null,"reasoning":"\nWe are going to calculate the escape velocity from Earth.\n Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a planet (or any massive body) without further propulsion.\n\n The physics behind it:\n We can use the conservation of energy. The total energy (kinetic plus potential) of an object at the surface of the Earth should be at least zero to escape to infinity (where potential energy is zero and kinetic energy is zero at rest).\n\n The gravitational potential energy (U) at a distance r from the center of the Earth is given by:\n   U = -G * (M * m) / r\n where:\n   G is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)\n   M is the mass of the Earth (5.972 × 10^24 kg)\n   m is the mass of the object\n   r is the distance from the center of the Earth (for the surface, r is the Earth's radius, 6.371 × 10^6 m)\n\n The kinetic energy (K) of the object is:\n   K = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\n For the object to escape, the total energy must be at least zero:\n   K + U >= 0\n   => (1/2)*m*v^2 - G*(M*m)/r >= 0\n\n Solving for v (escape velocity, v_e):\n   (1/2)*m*v^2 >= G*(M*m)/r\n   => v^2 >= (2*G*M)/r\n   => v >= sqrt(2*G*M / r)\n\n So the escape velocity is: v_e = sqrt(2*G*M / r)\n\n Let's plug in the values:\n   G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²\n   M = 5.972e24 kg\n   r = 6.371e6 m\n\n We can compute step by step:\n\n Step 1: Calculate G * M\n   G * M = 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = ?\n\n Step 2: Multiply by 2: 2 * G * M\n\n Step 3: Divide by r: (2 * G * M) / r\n\n Step 4: Take the square root.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a small program or use a calculator.\n\n Let me compute:\n\n   G * M = 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 3.986004196e14 (approximately)\n\n   Then, 2 * G * M = 7.972008392e14\n\n   Divide by r: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 1.2512e8\n\n   Then, sqrt(1.2512e8) = ?\n\n   sqrt(1.2512e8) = sqrt(125120000) ≈ 11186 m/s\n\n But let me do it more precisely:\n\n   We can use the known values and compute:\n\n   v_e = sqrt( (2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24) / 6.371e6 )\n\n   Let me calculate step by step:\n\n   Numerator: 2 * 6.67430e-11 = 1.33486e-10\n   Then multiply by M: 1.33486e-10 * 5.972e24 = 7.972008392e14\n   Then divide by r: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125120000. (approximately 1.2512e8)\n\n   Now, sqrt(125120000) = ?\n\n   We know that 11186^2 = 125,150,596 (which is a bit over)\n   Let me try 11186.5: 11186.5^2 = (11186)^2 + 2*11186*0.5 + (0.5)^2 ≈ 125,150,596 + 11186 + 0.25 ≈ 125,161,782.25 (too high)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   sqrt(125120000) = sqrt(1.2512e8) = 1000 * sqrt(125.12) ≈ 1000 * 11.186 ≈ 11186 m/s\n\n   But let's compute with more precision:\n\n   We can use the formula and known constants to get a standard value.\n\n   Actually, the commonly accepted escape velocity from Earth is about 11.2 km/s.\n\n   Let me compute with exact values:\n\n   G = 6.67430e-11\n   M = 5.972e24\n   r = 6.371e6\n\n   Step 1: 2 * G * M = 2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 2 * 3.986004196e14 = 7.972008392e14\n   Step 2: Divide by r: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125120000.0 (exactly? let me calculate: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125120000.0? Actually, let's do the division: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 1.251200000e8 approximately)\n\n   Now, sqrt(1.2512e8) = sqrt(125120000) = 11186.0 m/s (approximately)\n\n   But note: 11186 m/s is 11.186 km/s, which is about 11.2 km/s.\n\n   However, let's compute with more decimal places to see if we get exactly 11.2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the standard formula and known constants to get:\n\n   v_e = sqrt(2 * g * r)\n\n   where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the surface (g = G*M / r^2)\n\n   Then: v_e = sqrt(2 * (G*M / r^2) * r) = sqrt(2 * g * r)\n\n   g = 9.8 m/s², r = 6.371e6 m\n\n   Then: 2 * g * r = 2 * 9.8 * 6.371e6 = 2 * 9.8 * 6371000 = 2 * 62435800 = 124871600\n\n   Then sqrt(124871600) = 11175.5 m/s ≈ 11.176 km/s\n\n   This is close to 11.2 km/s. The slight difference is because g is not exactly 9.8 at the equator and we used an average.\n\n   The standard value is 11.186 km/s or about 11.2 km/s.\n\n   Therefore, we can report the escape velocity as approximately 11.2 km/s.\n\n   However, let's do the direct calculation with the constants:\n\n   Using:\n     G = 6.67430e-11\n     M = 5.972e24\n     r = 6.371e6\n\n   v_e = sqrt( (2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24) / 6.371e6 )\n        = sqrt( (7.972008392e14) / 6.371e6 )\n        = sqrt(1.251200000e8)\n        = 11186.0 m/s   (exactly as 11186.0)\n\n   So 11186 m/s is 11.186 km/s.\n\n   But note: the Earth's rotation can help if we launch from the equator in the direction of rotation, but we are calculating the pure escape velocity without any rotational assistance.\n\n   Therefore, the escape velocity from Earth is approximately 11.186 km/s (or about 11.2 km/s).\n\n   Let's write the code to compute it exactly with the given constants.\n\n   We'll use:\n     G = 6.67430e-11\n     M_earth = 5.972e24\n     r_earth = 6.371e6\n\n   Code:\n\n   v_escape = sqrt( (2 * G * M_earth) / r_earth )\n\n   Then convert to km/s by dividing by 1000.\n\n   Let me compute:\n\n   (2 * G * M_earth) = 2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 2 * 3.986004196e14 = 7.972008392e14\n   Then divide by r_earth: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125120000.0 (exactly? let's calculate: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125120000.0? Actually, it's 125120000.0 exactly? Not exactly, because:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125120000.0? Let me do:\n\n   7.972008392e14 = 797200839200000\n   6.371e6 = 6371000\n   797200839200000 / 6371000 = 125120000.0? Actually:\n\n   797200839200000 ÷ 6371000 = 125120000.0? Let me compute:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371000 * 1.2512e8 = 6371000 * 125120000 = ?\n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n   797200839200000 / 6371000 = 797200839200000 / 6371000 = 125120000.0? Actually, let me calculate:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371000 * 125120000 = 797,200,839,200,000? That matches the numerator? Let's see:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371 * 125120000 * 1000 = ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371000 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^(6+8) = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^14\n\n   6.371 * 1.2512 = 6.371 * 1.2512 = let's compute:\n\n      6.371 * 1.2 = 7.6452\n      6.371 * 0.0512 = 0.3261952\n      total = 7.9713952\n\n   So 7.9713952e14, which is close to 7.972008392e14? Not exactly. So we have to do the division exactly.\n\n   Actually, we are using:\n\n   v_e = sqrt( (2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24) / 6.371e6 )\n\n   Let me compute the numerator:\n\n   2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 2 * (6.67430 * 5.972) * 10^(-11+24) = 2 * (39.86004196) * 10^13 = 2 * 3.986004196e14 = 7.972008392e14\n\n   Then divide by 6.371e6: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = (7.972008392e14) / (6.371e6) = 1.251200000e8? Actually, let's do the division:\n\n   7.972008392e14 ÷ 6.371e6 = (7.972008392e14) / (6.371e6) = 1.251200000e8? \n\n   Calculate:\n\n   6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371e6 * 125120000 = 6.371 * 125120000 * 10^6? Actually, 6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^(6+8) = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^14\n\n   6.371 * 1.2512 = 6.371 * 1.2512 = 7.9713952\n\n   So 7.9713952e14, which is less than 7.972008392e14.\n\n   Therefore, we have to do:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125,120,000.0? Actually:\n\n   Let me compute:\n\n   6.371e6 * 125,120,000 = 6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 7.9713952e14 (which is less than 7.972008392e14 by about 0.000613192e14 = 6.13192e10)\n\n   So we need a slightly larger number. Let me compute the exact quotient:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125,120,000 + (7.972008392e14 - 7.9713952e14) / 6.371e6\n   = 125,120,000 + (0.000613192e14) / 6.371e6\n   = 125,120,000 + 6.13192e10 / 6.371e6\n   = 125,120,000 + 9624.0 (approximately)\n\n   So total = 125,129,624\n\n   Then sqrt(125,129,624) = ?\n\n   We know that 11186^2 = 125,150,596 (which is too high) and 11185^2 = 11185*11185.\n\n   Let me compute 11185^2:\n\n   11185 * 11185 = (11000+185)^2 = 11000^2 + 2*11000*185 + 185^2\n   = 121000000 + 4,070,000 + 34,225 = 125,104,225\n\n   Now 125,129,624 - 125,104,225 = 25,399\n\n   We need to add to 11185: let x be the increment, then (11185+x)^2 = 11185^2 + 2*11185*x + x^2 = 125,104,225 + 22,370x + x^2 = 125,129,624\n\n   So 22,370x + x^2 = 25,399\n\n   Approximate: 22,370x ≈ 25,399  => x ≈ 25,399 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   Then 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135\n\n   Check: 11186.135^2 = (11186 + 0.135)^2 = 11186^2 + 2*11186*0.135 + (0.135)^2\n   = 125,150,596 (from 11186^2) + 3,020.22 + 0.018225 ≈ 125,153,616.238 (too high)\n\n   This method is messy. Instead, we can use:\n\n   v_e = sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r ) = sqrt( (2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24) / 6.371e6 )\n\n   We can compute with a calculator:\n\n   Let me do:\n\n   numerator = 2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 7.972008392e14\n   denominator = 6.371e6\n   quotient = numerator / denominator = 125129624.0 (exactly? let me compute with more digits)\n\n   Actually, we can compute:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125129624.0 (approximately)\n\n   Then sqrt(125129624.0) = ?\n\n   We can use the fact that 11186^2 = 125150596 (which is more than 125129624) and 11185^2=125104225.\n\n   Let me compute the difference:\n\n   target = 125129624\n   lower = 11185^2 = 125104225\n   difference = 125129624 - 125104225 = 25399\n\n   The derivative: 2 * 11185 = 22370\n\n   So increment = 25399 / 22370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   Then v_e ≈ 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135 m/s\n\n   But wait, 11186.135^2 = 11186^2 + 2*11186*0.135 + 0.135^2 = 125150596 + 3020.22 + 0.018225 = 125153616.238225, which is more than 125129624.\n\n   So we must have made a mistake in the initial calculation of the quotient.\n\n   Let me recalculate the quotient:\n\n   numerator = 7.972008392e14\n   denominator = 6.371e6 = 6371000\n\n   quotient = 7.972008392e14 / 6371000 = ?\n\n   Let me do:\n\n   797200839200000 / 6371000 = ?\n\n   First, 6371000 * 125000000 = 6371000 * 1.25e8 = 796,375,000,000,000\n\n   Subtract: 797,200,839,200,000 - 796,375,000,000,000 = 825,839,200,000\n\n   Now, 6371000 * 129624 = ?\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   825,839,200,000 / 6371000 = 129,624.0 (approximately)\n\n   So total quotient = 125000000 + 129624 = 125,129,624\n\n   So the quotient is 125,129,624.\n\n   Now, sqrt(125,129,624) = ?\n\n   We can compute:\n\n   Let me try 11186: 11186^2 = 125,150,596 (too big)\n\n   Try 11185: 11185^2 = 125,104,225\n\n   Now, 125,129,624 - 125,104,225 = 25,399\n\n   Now, the next digit: we can use linear approximation:\n\n   increment = 25,399 / (2 * 11185) = 25,399 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   So v_e ≈ 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135 m/s\n\n   But 11186.135^2 = 11186^2 + 2*11186*0.135 + 0.135^2 = 125,150,596 + 3,020.22 + 0.018225 = 125,153,616.238225 (which is way above 125,129,624)\n\n   So what went wrong? We must have miscalculated the increment.\n\n   Actually, we should use:\n\n   (11185 + x)^2 = 11185^2 + 2*11185*x + x^2 = 125,104,225 + 22,370*x + x^2 = 125,129,624\n\n   So 22,370*x + x^2 = 25,399\n\n   We can solve the quadratic: x^2 + 22,370x - 25,399 = 0? No, it's equal to 25,399.\n\n   So: 22,370*x + x^2 = 25,399\n\n   Since x is small, x^2 is very small. So:\n\n   22,370*x ≈ 25,399  => x ≈ 25,399 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   But then 22,370 * 1.135 = 25,409.95, which is more than 25,399.\n\n   So we need a bit less. Let me try x=1.134:\n\n   22,370 * 1.134 = 22,370 * 1.134 = 22,370 * (1 + 0.134) = 22,370 + 22,370*0.134 = 22,370 + 2,997.58 = 25,367.58\n\n   Then 25,367.58 + (1.134)^2 = 25,367.58 + 1.286 = 25,368.866\n\n   We need 25,399, so we are short by 30.134.\n\n   Then we need to add a little more: let y be the additional increment (so total x=1.134+y), then:\n\n   22,370 * (1.134+y) + (1.134+y)^2 = 25,368.866 + 22,370*y + 2*1.134*y + y^2\n\n   We want this to be 25,399.\n\n   So: 25,368.866 + 22,370*y + 2.268*y + y^2 = 25,399\n\n   => 22,372.268*y + y^2 = 30.134\n\n   Since y is small, 22,372.268*y ≈ 30.134 => y ≈ 30.134 / 22,372.268 ≈ 0.001347\n\n   So total x ≈ 1.134 + 0.001347 = 1.135347\n\n   Then v_e = 11185 + 1.135347 = 11186.135347 m/s\n\n   But then we are over because 22,370 * 1.135347 = 22,370 * 1.135347 ≈ 25,399.0 (exactly as needed)\n\n   However, we must also add the square of x (which is about 1.29) and we already included it in the equation? Actually, we did.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a calculator to compute sqrt(125129624) = 11186.000? Let me check:\n\n   Actually, note that 11186^2 = 125,150,596, which is more than 125,129,624.\n\n   We can use:\n\n   sqrt(125129624) = sqrt(125104225 + 25399) = ?\n\n   But it's easier to use the fact that:\n\n   (11186.0)^2 = 125150596\n   (11185.0)^2 = 125104225\n\n   We want 125129624, which is 125129624 - 125104225 = 25399 above 11185^2.\n\n   The difference between 11186^2 and 11185^2 is 2*11185+1 = 22371.\n\n   So we are 25399/22371 of the way from 11185 to 11186? That would be about 1.135, so 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135.\n\n   But we see that 11186.135^2 is 125,153,616.238225, which is too high.\n\n   So we must have made a mistake in the quotient.\n\n   Let me double-check the quotient:\n\n   numerator = 2 * G * M = 2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 2 * 3.986004196e14 = 7.972008392e14\n\n   denominator = 6.371e6 = 6371000\n\n   quotient = 7.972008392e14 / 6371000 = ?\n\n   Let me do the division:\n\n   7.972008392e14 ÷ 6371000 = 797200839200000 ÷ 6371000\n\n   First, 6371000 * 125000000 = 6371000 * 125000000 = 796,375,000,000,000\n\n   Subtract: 797,200,839,200,000 - 796,375,000,000,000 = 825,839,200,000\n\n   Now, 6371000 * 129624 = ?\n\n   Let me compute 6371000 * 129624:\n\n   First, 6371000 * 100000 = 637,100,000,000\n   Then, 6371000 * 29624 = ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   825,839,200,000 / 6371000 = 825,839,200,000 ÷ 6371000\n\n   6371000 * 129,624 = 6371000 * (130,000 - 376) = 6371000*130000 - 6371000*376\n\n   = 828,230,000,000 - 2,395,496,000 = 825,834,504,000\n\n   Then, we have 825,839,200,000 - 825,834,504,000 = 4,696,000\n\n   Then, 4,696,000 / 6371000 ≈ 0.737\n\n   So total quotient = 125000000 + 129624 + 0.737 = 125,129,624.737\n\n   So the quotient is 125,129,624.737\n\n   Then sqrt(125,129,624.737) = ?\n\n   We know 11185^2 = 125,104,225\n\n   The difference is 125,129,624.737 - 125,104,225 = 25,399.737\n\n   Then increment x = 25,399.737 / (2 * 11185) = 25,399.737 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135347\n\n   So v_e = 11185 + 1.135347 = 11186.135347 m/s\n\n   But this is still around 11186.135 m/s.\n\n   However, note that the standard value is about 11.186 km/s, which is 11186 m/s.\n\n   So we can report it as 11186 m/s.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula with the standard gravitational parameter for Earth, which is μ = 3.986004418e14 m^3/s^2.\n\n   Then v_e = sqrt(2 * μ / r) = sqrt(2 * 3.986004418e14 / 6.371e6) = sqrt(7.972008836e14 / 6.371e6) = sqrt(1.251200000e8) = 11186.0 m/s.\n\n   So it's exactly 11186 m/s.\n\n   Therefore, we will go with 11186 m/s.\n\n   Conclusion: escape velocity from Earth is 11186 m/s or 11.186 km/s.\n\n   However, in many sources, it is rounded to 11.2 km/s.\n\n   But for precision, we can state it as 11.186 km/s.\n\n   Let's code it to be sure.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n   G = 6.67430e-11\n   M = 5.972e24\n   r = 6.371e6\n\n   v_escape = math.sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r )\n\n   Then convert to km/s by dividing by 1000.\n\n   We expect about 11.186 km/s.\n\n   Let me write the code in Python:\n\n   import math\n\n   G = 6.67430e-11\n   M = 5.972e24\n   r = 6.371e6\n\n   v_escape = math.sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r )\n   v_escape_kmps = v_escape / 1000\n\n   print(v_escape_kmps)\n\n   This should output approximately 11.186.","reasoning_details":[{"type":"reasoning.text","text":"\nWe are going to calculate the escape velocity from Earth.\n Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a planet (or any massive body) without further propulsion.\n\n The physics behind it:\n We can use the conservation of energy.

Actually, let me calculate:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371000 * 125120000 = 797,200,839,200,000? That matches the numerator? Let's see:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371 * 125120000 * 1000 = ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   6371000 * 125120000 = 6371000 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^(6+8) = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^14\n\n   6.371 * 1.2512 = 6.371 * 1.2512 = let's compute:\n\n      6.371 * 1.2 = 7.6452\n      6.371 * 0.0512 = 0.3261952\n      total = 7.9713952\n\n   So 7.9713952e14, which is close to 7.972008392e14? Not exactly. So we have to do the division exactly.\n\n   Actually, we are using:\n\n   v_e = sqrt( (2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24) / 6.371e6 )\n\n   Let me compute the numerator:\n\n   2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 2 * (6.67430 * 5.972) * 10^(-11+24) = 2 * (39.86004196) * 10^13 = 2 * 3.986004196e14 = 7.972008392e14\n\n   Then divide by 6.371e6: 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = (7.972008392e14) / (6.371e6) = 1.251200000e8? Actually, let's do the division:\n\n   7.972008392e14 ÷ 6.371e6 = (7.972008392e14) / (6.371e6) = 1.251200000e8? \n\n   Calculate:\n\n   6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371e6 * 125120000 = 6.371 * 125120000 * 10^6? Actually, 6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^(6+8) = 6.371 * 1.2512 * 10^14\n\n   6.371 * 1.2512 = 6.371 * 1.2512 = 7.9713952\n\n   So 7.9713952e14, which is less than 7.972008392e14.\n\n   Therefore, we have to do:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125,120,000.0? Actually:\n\n   Let me compute:\n\n   6.371e6 * 125,120,000 = 6.371e6 * 1.2512e8 = 7.9713952e14 (which is less than 7.972008392e14 by about 0.000613192e14 = 6.13192e10)\n\n   So we need a slightly larger number. Let me compute the exact quotient:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125,120,000 + (7.972008392e14 - 7.9713952e14) / 6.371e6\n   = 125,120,000 + (0.000613192e14) / 6.371e6\n   = 125,120,000 + 6.13192e10 / 6.371e6\n   = 125,120,000 + 9624.0 (approximately)\n\n   So total = 125,129,624\n\n   Then sqrt(125,129,624) = ?\n\n   We know that 11186^2 = 125,150,596 (which is too high) and 11185^2 = 11185*11185.\n\n   Let me compute 11185^2:\n\n   11185 * 11185 = (11000+185)^2 = 11000^2 + 2*11000*185 + 185^2\n   = 121000000 + 4,070,000 + 34,225 = 125,104,225\n\n   Now 125,129,624 - 125,104,225 = 25,399\n\n   We need to add to 11185: let x be the increment, then (11185+x)^2 = 11185^2 + 2*11185*x + x^2 = 125,104,225 + 22,370x + x^2 = 125,129,624\n\n   So 22,370x + x^2 = 25,399\n\n   Approximate: 22,370x ≈ 25,399  => x ≈ 25,399 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   Then 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135\n\n   Check: 11186.135^2 = (11186 + 0.135)^2 = 11186^2 + 2*11186*0.135 + (0.135)^2\n   = 125,150,596 (from 11186^2) + 3,020.22 + 0.018225 ≈ 125,153,616.238 (too high)\n\n   This method is messy. Instead, we can use:\n\n   v_e = sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r ) = sqrt( (2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24) / 6.371e6 )\n\n   We can compute with a calculator:\n\n   Let me do:\n\n   numerator = 2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 7.972008392e14\n   denominator = 6.371e6\n   quotient = numerator / denominator = 125129624.0 (exactly? let me compute with more digits)\n\n   Actually, we can compute:\n\n   7.972008392e14 / 6.371e6 = 125129624.0 (approximately)\n\n   Then sqrt(125129624.0) = ?\n\n   We can use the fact that 11186^2 = 125150596 (which is more than 125129624) and 11185^2=125104225.\n\n   Let me compute the difference:\n\n   target = 125129624\n   lower = 11185^2 = 125104225\n   difference = 125129624 - 125104225 = 25399\n\n   The derivative: 2 * 11185 = 22370\n\n   So increment = 25399 / 22370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   Then v_e ≈ 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135 m/s\n\n   But wait, 11186.135^2 = 11186^2 + 2*11186*0.135 + 0.135^2 = 125150596 + 3020.22 + 0.018225 = 125153616.238225, which is more than 125129624.\n\n   So we must have made a mistake in the initial calculation of the quotient.\n\n   Let me recalculate the quotient:\n\n   numerator = 7.972008392e14\n   denominator = 6.371e6 = 6371000\n\n   quotient = 7.972008392e14 / 6371000 = ?\n\n   Let me do:\n\n   797200839200000 / 6371000 = ?\n\n   First, 6371000 * 125000000 = 6371000 * 1.25e8 = 796,375,000,000,000\n\n   Subtract: 797,200,839,200,000 - 796,375,000,000,000 = 825,839,200,000\n\n   Now, 6371000 * 129624 = ?\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   825,839,200,000 / 6371000 = 129,624.0 (approximately)\n\n   So total quotient = 125000000 + 129624 = 125,129,624\n\n   So the quotient is 125,129,624.\n\n   Now, sqrt(125,129,624) = ?\n\n   We can compute:\n\n   Let me try 11186: 11186^2 = 125,150,596 (too big)\n\n   Try 11185: 11185^2 = 125,104,225\n\n   Now, 125,129,624 - 125,104,225 = 25,399\n\n   Now, the next digit: we can use linear approximation:\n\n   increment = 25,399 / (2 * 11185) = 25,399 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   So v_e ≈ 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135 m/s\n\n   But 11186.135^2 = 11186^2 + 2*11186*0.135 + 0.135^2 = 125,150,596 + 3,020.22 + 0.018225 = 125,153,616.238225 (which is way above 125,129,624)\n\n   So what went wrong? We must have miscalculated the increment.\n\n   Actually, we should use:\n\n   (11185 + x)^2 = 11185^2 + 2*11185*x + x^2 = 125,104,225 + 22,370*x + x^2 = 125,129,624\n\n   So 22,370*x + x^2 = 25,399\n\n   We can solve the quadratic: x^2 + 22,370x - 25,399 = 0? No, it's equal to 25,399.\n\n   So: 22,370*x + x^2 = 25,399\n\n   Since x is small, x^2 is very small. So:\n\n   22,370*x ≈ 25,399  => x ≈ 25,399 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135\n\n   But then 22,370 * 1.135 = 25,409.95, which is more than 25,399.\n\n   So we need a bit less. Let me try x=1.134:\n\n   22,370 * 1.134 = 22,370 * 1.134 = 22,370 * (1 + 0.134) = 22,370 + 22,370*0.134 = 22,370 + 2,997.58 = 25,367.58\n\n   Then 25,367.58 + (1.134)^2 = 25,367.58 + 1.286 = 25,368.866\n\n   We need 25,399, so we are short by 30.134.\n\n   Then we need to add a little more: let y be the additional increment (so total x=1.134+y), then:\n\n   22,370 * (1.134+y) + (1.134+y)^2 = 25,368.866 + 22,370*y + 2*1.134*y + y^2\n\n   We want this to be 25,399.\n\n   So: 25,368.866 + 22,370*y + 2.268*y + y^2 = 25,399\n\n   => 22,372.268*y + y^2 = 30.134\n\n   Since y is small, 22,372.268*y ≈ 30.134 => y ≈ 30.134 / 22,372.268 ≈ 0.001347\n\n   So total x ≈ 1.134 + 0.001347 = 1.135347\n\n   Then v_e = 11185 + 1.135347 = 11186.135347 m/s\n\n   But then we are over because 22,370 * 1.135347 = 22,370 * 1.135347 ≈ 25,399.0 (exactly as needed)\n\n   However, we must also add the square of x (which is about 1.29) and we already included it in the equation? Actually, we did.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a calculator to compute sqrt(125129624) = 11186.000? Let me check:\n\n   Actually, note that 11186^2 = 125,150,596, which is more than 125,129,624.\n\n   We can use:\n\n   sqrt(125129624) = sqrt(125104225 + 25399) = ?\n\n   But it's easier to use the fact that:\n\n   (11186.0)^2 = 125150596\n   (11185.0)^2 = 125104225\n\n   We want 125129624, which is 125129624 - 125104225 = 25399 above 11185^2.\n\n   The difference between 11186^2 and 11185^2 is 2*11185+1 = 22371.\n\n   So we are 25399/22371 of the way from 11185 to 11186? That would be about 1.135, so 11185 + 1.135 = 11186.135.\n\n   But we see that 11186.135^2 is 125,153,616.238225, which is too high.\n\n   So we must have made a mistake in the quotient.\n\n   Let me double-check the quotient:\n\n   numerator = 2 * G * M = 2 * 6.67430e-11 * 5.972e24 = 2 * 3.986004196e14 = 7.972008392e14\n\n   denominator = 6.371e6 = 6371000\n\n   quotient = 7.972008392e14 / 6371000 = ?\n\n   Let me do the division:\n\n   7.972008392e14 ÷ 6371000 = 797200839200000 ÷ 6371000\n\n   First, 6371000 * 125000000 = 6371000 * 125000000 = 796,375,000,000,000\n\n   Subtract: 797,200,839,200,000 - 796,375,000,000,000 = 825,839,200,000\n\n   Now, 6371000 * 129624 = ?\n\n   Let me compute 6371000 * 129624:\n\n   First, 6371000 * 100000 = 637,100,000,000\n   Then, 6371000 * 29624 = ?\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   825,839,200,000 / 6371000 = 825,839,200,000 ÷ 6371000\n\n   6371000 * 129,624 = 6371000 * (130,000 - 376) = 6371000*130000 - 6371000*376\n\n   = 828,230,000,000 - 2,395,496,000 = 825,834,504,000\n\n   Then, we have 825,839,200,000 - 825,834,504,000 = 4,696,000\n\n   Then, 4,696,000 / 6371000 ≈ 0.737\n\n   So total quotient = 125000000 + 129624 + 0.737 = 125,129,624.737\n\n   So the quotient is 125,129,624.737\n\n   Then sqrt(125,129,624.737) = ?\n\n   We know 11185^2 = 125,104,225\n\n   The difference is 125,129,624.737 - 125,104,225 = 25,399.737\n\n   Then increment x = 25,399.737 / (2 * 11185) = 25,399.737 / 22,370 ≈ 1.135347\n\n   So v_e = 11185 + 1.135347 = 11186.135347 m/s\n\n   But this is still around 11186.135 m/s.\n\n   However, note that the standard value is about 11.186 km/s, which is 11186 m/s.\n\n   So we can report it as 11186 m/s.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the formula with the standard gravitational parameter for Earth, which is μ = 3.986004418e14 m^3/s^2.\n\n   Then v_e = sqrt(2 * μ / r) = sqrt(2 * 3.986004418e14 / 6.371e6) = sqrt(7.972008836e14 / 6.371e6) = sqrt(1.251200000e8) = 11186.0 m/s.\n\n   So it's exactly 11186 m/s.\n\n   Therefore, we will go with 11186 m/s.\n\n   Conclusion: escape velocity from Earth is 11186 m/s or 11.186 km/s.\n\n   However, in many sources, it is rounded to 11.2 km/s.\n\n   But for precision, we can state it as 11.186 km/s.\n\n   Let's code it to be sure.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n   G = 6.67430e-11\n   M = 5.972e24\n   r = 6.371e6\n\n   v_escape = math.sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r )\n\n   Then convert to km/s by dividing by 1000.\n\n   We expect about 11.186 km/s.\n\n   Let me write the code in Python:\n\n   import math\n\n   G = 6.67430e-11\n   M = 5.972e24\n   r = 6.371e6\n\n   v_escape = math.sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r )\n   v_escape_kmps = v_escape / 1000\n\n   print(v_escape_kmps)\n\n   This should output approximately 11.186.","format":"unknown","index":0}]}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":22,"completion_tokens":7633,"total_tokens":7655,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":4}}}
